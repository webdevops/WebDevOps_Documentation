==========================
Documentation organization
==========================

| The Team WebDevOps is a Project that is aimed to produce a couple of Projects to make Web-Development and common DevOps tasks easier.
| We want a distinct Documentation for each Project, which is why we split each documentation to be handled by the Project itself.
|
| This way we can assure that each Project Documentaton can grow alongside with the Project itself and you are able to Switch the versions of the Documentation for each Project.
|

--------------------------------
Navigation trough Documentations
--------------------------------

| In the left sidebar, you can find links to our Project documentations.
| Each documentation has an additional menu on the bottom to allow you to switch between versions of the Project Documentation.
|
| The Versions are aligned with the current tags of the GitHub Repository and start with the first version released with this documentation.
| The latest version of the documenatation will correspond to the current master (or actively developed branch).
