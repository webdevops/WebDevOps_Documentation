==========================
Documentation organization
==========================

| The Team WebDevOps is a Project that is aimed to produce a couple of Projects to make Web-Development and common DevOps tasks easier.
| We want clear and distinct Documentation for each Project, which is why we split each document to be handled by the Project itself.
|
| This way we can be sure that each Project Documentation can grow alongside the Project itself and you are able to Switch the versions of the Documentation for each Project.
|
|

--------------------------------
Navigate through our Documentation
--------------------------------

| In the left-hand sidebar, you will find links to our Project documentation.
| Each documentation has an additional menu on the bottom to allow you to switch between various versions of the Project Documentation.
|
| The Versions are aligned with the current tags of the GitHub Repository and start with the first version released with this documentation.
| The latest version of the documenatation will correspond to the current master or actively developed branch.
